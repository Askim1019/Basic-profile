        <p>In March of 2017, I had shadowed a tech company that one of my best friends worked at. I wanted to
        see what went on inside of a tech company. At the time, I was in my fourth year working as a Microbiologist in
        a laboratory in Schaumburg, Illinois. The job that I have is great and the people I work with are amazing, but I was looking to
        be more challenged in a more project-oriented setting. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>The day I shadowed is the day I already knew that I wanted to become a software
        engineer and developer. The experience blew me away! After seeing how engineers could make complicated apps with 
        mostly just a couple of words and text editors, I was hooked. I started to code in every possible way I could. \
        I'll admit that I spread myself thin in the beginning. I toyed around with Python in Codecademy and I didn't master it at all.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p> I then continued to code in Ruby, Ruby on Rails for a couple of months as well as diving into HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript,
        SQL, Java, algorithms, and learning git version control as well. Everytime I learned something new, I realized how much more I didn't 
        know. It is now 2018. After finishing a couple of my own tutorial projects,
        I decided to join Northwestern Coding Bootcamp after one year of self-teaching. I wanted to collaborate 
        and network while learning to code in the M.E.R.N technology stack.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>I am currently looking to start my career in the world of software development. I am excited to see what I can do 
            with the skills taught at the bootcamp.
